Electronic Cow software
---------------------------------------------------------------
This program is sort-of-shareware, which means that if you like 
it and use it regularly, you should send us some money, 
presents or Lego to say thank you. In return, as well as 
getting a lovely warm glow inside from doing something nice, 
we'll send you a printed manual, box and the software on disk. 
We'll also help you out with technical support via e-mail, and 
if lots of people register the program, we might even write 
some updates. : ) 

You may freely copy this program and distribute it on cover 
CD-ROMs, disks, Web and FTP sites, so long as no charges are 
made for the software. These conditions apply only if all the 
files remain in the ZIP files, and that they all remain 
unaltered. This program still remains the copyright of 
Electronic Cow and any unauthorised alterations or charging for 
its distribution is, to be a bit blunt, completely illegal. 
Just have fun with it, and everyone will be happy.

This program is supplied as is, and neither Electronic Cow or 
the program's authors will accept any responsible for any loss, 
consequential or otherwise as a result of the use and/or misuse 
of the program. The moral is: don't tamper with it, and it will 
work.
