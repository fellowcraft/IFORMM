          QuickScore       V1.0       Jan 8, 1990



We have included a KCS .ALL file as well as a .DIS (display) file 
for QuickScore on this disk. Loading this file in KCS and then 
looking at it in QuickScore will display the correct clef 
automatically for each staff.

When playing in full score display mode, only the first recorded 
track will play.

If the transcription of your music looks wrong (especially when a 
track contains a lot of sixteenth notes syncopations, try 
reducing the number of bars per lines. (2 does well with 
sixteenth note, see demo file)

QuickScore is only designed to be used in the MPE environment and 
will not work as a stand alone program.

QuickScore will only run in KCS or Level 2 V3.0 or later.
