Intro and Excuses      
-----------------------
     I could continue hacking away at this forever, unfortunately people at
     work have decided that 1989 is going to be Gerry's Year of Anguish so I
     beter get this off to you and get back to being overworked.
     
     Please forgive any typos, syntax shifts into shrieking void, and an
     inability to speak consistenly about transpositions in terms of single
     programatic steps (C to C#) or what are called in music parlance
     "half-steps" (also C to C#).
     
     I've been digging through various incarnations of my VRY files in
     anticipation of telling you how I am using the KCS/PVG and am somewhat
     disheartened and gladdened simultaneously.  In surveying the scope of
     this package I am reminded of two things; how little I truly understand
     and utilize it, and also how delightful the process of constant
     exploration is.
     
     I am also reminded of an article read quite some while ago about
     synthesizer service technicians.  Seems they found that 95% of the
     synths that come in for repair have the factory presets in them.  Wonder
     if this is the case, generally, for the PVG.  If so, they better start
     shipping some extra VRY files on the program disk.
     
     The music I create is of a tonal, hopefully homogenous and usually
     highly structured variety.  Some of the initial presets in the Default
     VRY file were fun to play with, but are highly doubtful for regular
     usage.  I still find this particularly true of the Add Controllers and
     Vary Controllers screens.  I have modified most of them to affect the
     breath control of my TX81Z for volume swells, and the breath control of
     my Matrix-6, where it can function as almost anything depending on the
     routing on the synth.  This is all very good and it took me quite a
     while to implement, but in all candor I do not use them except once in a
     great while.  But when I want them, I REALLY want them.
     

Edit Echo and Stuff    
-----------------------
     I didn't realise that this was was a hidden feature until I heard a user
     mention his desire for it wistfully.  You CAN have merge/echo functional
     while o the edit page.  Of course it will function while you are playing
     the seq/track at hand but when you want the echo without the seq, just
     hit pause.  Echo continues to operate.
     
     I always forget that clicking with both mouse buttons plays the current
     cue from the edit page, I also always forget to shift-click a sequence
     to stop it.  It will put the area that I was listening to when it
     stopped at about 2/3's down the screen.  Hitting the Alt key will not
     only bring back a range you slipped on, it will bring back the last two,
     back and forth.
     
     I always forget to use "Calc", I just sort of take a wild guess at the
     distances between 8 bars and 32 bars and then eyeball it back into
     place.  It really is silly when "Calc" is lying there.  I guess that's
     what you get when you have followed this package from the original 64
     through the C128 version (the most underrated seq'r of all time).
     
     I consider myself a novice only because everytime I dig deeply into this
     program, I'm discovering it all over again.  There are just SO MANY
     options from which to choose.  The first time I loaded Fingers and
     Tunesmith into the KCS w/PVG it was truly awe-inspiring just to flip the
     pages! What an environment!
     
     
PVG Notes              
-----------------------
     Probably my most used macro activity, is for harmonizations of one kind
     or another.
     
     This is how I do it:
     
     I have one preset consisting of a transposition up one step, and another
     to transpose down one step.  I place a "4" in the Ops column in the
     macro area. This will transpose the affected sequence up a single step
     four times: a major third.
     
     The second line in the macro fine tunes this as necessary for the key of
     C.  This would mean all notes that have been transposed to a note not
     modally appropriate to the key of C will be modified.  These would be
     major thirds that need to be minor.  I set up my protection on the
     "Global1" screen to represent the scale-tone steps of the key of C, and
     place a weight next to Pitch set to -1;  transposing all unprotected
     notes down one step.  Anything that makes it through the protection
     template would be a violation of the key of C.  Viola!  An accurate
     transposition of a third, true to one key, C.
     
     At first I decided to set up special macros that would let me do this
     for thirds, fifths and sevenths for my most predominantly used keys.  In
     the end it ate up to many of my precious preset slots. I decided it was
     wiser just to add a transposition to the key of C at the beginning of
     the procedure and to transpose back down to the original key at the end,
     effectively doing all actual manipulation and fine-tuning in the key of
     C.
     
     This is really much less difficult than it probably sounds.  Okay, an
     example.  I'm in A and want a harmony build on the third step, or
     "thirds":
     
            Preset                 OPS
            ------                 ---
            Tran Vari Up           1 (Transpose me up X steps to C)
            Trans up 1             4 (Takes me up the major 3rd)
            Tweak for Thirds       1 (Take any C#D#F#G#A#'s down 1/2 step)
            Trans Vari Dn          1 (Transposes me down X steps to A again)
     
     When I am working in a key other than C I simple go to the two presets
     (TranVariUp and TranVariDn) and modify the Global 2 screen to effect a
     transposition relative to C.  If I'm in A TranVari Up should be a 3 step
     transposition up, TranVariDn would be -3.  If I'm in Eb TranVariUp would
     again UP, nine steps, TranVariDn would be -9.  I always transpose up to
     get to the key of C, do what is called for, and then back down again.
     If I actually want the parallel harmony to be, say a sixth below, I just
     tack on another Trans Dn 1 and the end of the macro set Ops to 12.
     After modifiying the 2 Vari's all macros that reference them, (harmonize
     5th, 7th, 9th, etc.)  will work without any extra modification.
     

Splitting Blocks  
-----------------------
     The Dr.T products are amazingly open-ended, sometimes you can get lost
     at the beginning.  Regarding the first screen,"Changes", I have labored
     long and hard and have little to show for my experiences.  But I admit I
     usually want a decisive mechanism to control things; "deterministic" as
     Emile has typified it.  And sometimes it's important to me to know that
     I'M the one with the reigns--by using them.
     
     Instead, my predominant method of "randomization" (a word that bugs me)
     is from the "Swap" screen.  It keeps things so homogenous just to
     reshuffle the same deck. The "Consecutive" aspects on the other side of
     this screen and the also pattern screen are getting my renewed
     attention.  To date, and I've had every update for the past year and a
     half, I have yet to make consistent use of numerous aspects of the PVG.
     
     I find with all of these capabilities that you have to go through them
     in a long slow cycle, investigating, cataloging.  I find this apprach
     more fun that I can express.  But in the end the techniques that you
     remember are the techniques that you use for something other than
     vehicle for idle curiosity.
     
     Sometimes I create alot of raw material, either through improvisation,
     or from output from Fingers, the PVG, or Tunesmith.  Perhaps 120 or so
     bars.  Obviously this is too much material to make any cohesive use of
     in a single block.
     
     I have been trying to find a way to copy off the first 16 bars, then the
     2nd 16 bars and so on.  Then I can manipulate each 16 bar block until
     it's usable, or to examine it long enough to realize it's useless.
     After culling through this material, I might 2-3 ideas I can make use of
     elsewhere.
     
     The following splits it off:
     
                    Macro   From    To      Loop    OPS
                    -----   ----    --      ----    ---
                    Erase    17     32       __      1
                    Erase    1      16       __      1
     
     This is not exactly perfection, but if the range unit is set to measure,
     and variations to 2, it will copy the original sequence, hack off the
     last 16 bars, copy the original sequence and hack off the first 16 bars.

     Obviously this could be done for 4, or 8 or 32 bars, and I could use
     Delete instead of erase.  Unfortunately I am unsure how to go about
     repeating this process, starting with a file of say 72 bars and hacking
     it up into 9 8-bar phrases, each in a different seq or track slot.
     

Sysex Storage          
-----------------------
A few comments on how I handle sysex storage sequences. I enter 
the following into a sequence:

            MSR- ST EVNT  TIME CH TYP NOTE VEL DUR
            ------- ----  ---- -- --- ---- --- ---
              1-  1    1     0     SM   12
              1-  1    2     0     TM  135  0
     
     The number of counts to a bar (SM = steps per measure) is now 12 instead
     of 96.  The reason for this is that I store a block of sysex (one patch
     or one set-up) per each 12 count.  After doing 8 of these I return to 96
     clocks per bar.  The net effect of this is that my initial sysex
     addressing of the system takes a 4 "beats" count.  Sometimes I merge it
     with 4 rum-shots from my drum-machine and use it as a count off.
     
     When I need to edit it (not my favorite task)  I simply outline and play
     the first 2-5 elements of my sysex sequence (effectively resetting time
     to 12 clocks per bar) then I click on "Find" and request bar 5--bingo,
     I'm staring at my FB01 sysex.  My format is consistent so I don't have
     to bother thinking about it at creative moments:
     
               Bar 1:   1 Matrix-6 patch dump (output to patch #97)
               Bar 2:   1 Matrix-6 patch dump (output to patch #98)
               Bar 3:   Sysex telling Matrix-6 to go to split mode.
               Bar 4:   TX81Z Patch command, and configuration dump
               Bar 5:   FB01 configuration dump
               Bar 6:   CZ1 configuration information.
               Bar 7/8: A slot waiting for a brand new EPS, also other varied
                        sysex.
     
     If I put them all of this in one sequence with no considerations then it
     is a mess trying to find out where a specific sysex dump is located if I
     need to change it.  I could do without the changing the steps per
     measure to 12, I guess, but then I would be preceeding each tune with 4
     bars of silence in order to output about 2 seconds or less of actual
     sysex, or if it was 3/4 of a bar then my measure counter would be off
     till forever.
     
     Then I go to the play screen.  I hit 0 to get to the options page, and
     toggle the sysex record button on.  Returning puts me on the play screen
     where I hit enter and undo.  This sets me up to record and resets me to
     0 in anticipation for incoming sysex.
     
     For the FB01 I go to the system setup button (upper right on the front
     panel) and click till I see option #1 DUMP.  Then I hit the +/YES button
     till it says config (If it already says it, I have to hit it anyway and
     then come back), then the System setup button again.  The LCD asks If I
     am sure.  I am.  As soon as I enter +/YES to this query I notice that
     the word "SYSEX" has popped up on my play screen.  If I can see it, it's
     time to turn it off.  Sysex travels fast.
     
     I exit to the edit mode and set the last event to 12 and insure that the
     first event is 0.  The whole length, then is 12.
     
     I repeat this with the TX81Z.  Here though, I must only go to another
     patch, turn on the record mechanism, and then hit the button going back
     to the patch that I actually want to store.  If it is a Config I am
     going to, and not a single patch, then I must preceed the sysex with a
     program change that puts me in my Config area.  In my case it is patch
     50.
     
     The TX81Z doesn't respond as rapidly to sysex as some other machines.  For
     this reason I have to do it like this:
     
            MSR- ST EVNT  TIME CH TYP NOTE VEL DUR
            ------- ----  ---- -- --- ---- --- ---
              4-  1   22     0  6  PG   50   0
              4-  1   23     6      *  240
                     More sysex goes here...
              5-  1  423     6    DE
     
     Notice that instead of having a 12 at the end I must split it into two
     increments of 6 each.  Yamaha is slow to pick up on instructions
     sometimes, and has to be fed this info in two statemenst or goes into
     "MIDI Data Error!" afterwhich it refuses to listen to ANY instruction.
     So, I issue the patch request, wait for 6 clocks, send the sysex, and
     then wait another 6 clocks.  Nevertheless the total is 12.
     
     The whole shebang looks like this...
     
            MSR- ST EVNT  TIME CH TYP NOTE VEL DUR
            ------- ----  ---- -- --- ---- --- ---
              1-  1    1     0     SM      12
              1-  1    2     0     TM      130
              1-  1    3     0      *      240
                          ...
                 I load a patch to slot 97 on my matrix 6 here.
                          ...
              2-  1  201    12     DE
              2-  1  202     0      *      240
                          ...
                 I load a patch to slot 98 on my matrix 6 here.
                          ...
              3-  1  351    12     DE
              3-  1  352     0     *       240
                          ...
                 I load MAT6 sysex that switches me to split mode.
                 Almost all my splits refer to patches 97 and 98,
                 so I select a split patch that juggles the two voices
                 appropriately.
                          ...
              4-  1  554     6     PG       50
              4-  1  555     6      *      240
                          ...
                 TX81Z Patch ("go to the splits area of memory"), wait
                 6 clocks, then feed the sysex.
                          ...
              5-  1  638     6    DE
              5-  1  639     0     *    240
                          ...
                   CZ1 sysex goes here.  Unfortunately, you can't initiate
                   a single patch sysex dump from the CZ1 front panel.
                   Most of mine was hand assembled with the manual to do
                   split tasks and multi assignments.
                          ...
              6-  1  691    12    DE
              6-  1  692     0 10 PG   10
                          ...
                   Various other patches that are from non-sysexing a variety
                   of synths.
              9-  1  702    24    SM   96
                   Return to 96 beats per minute.
     
     This is more sysex than I do on every single tune, but I have tried to
     be consistent in my format.  There is nothing worse that digging
     up some old tune only to spend an hour tweaking patches till you get to
     a rough approximation of the original piece.  When I call up a tune, new
     or old, I want it to fire off instructions to take it back to the EXACT
     moment of time I created it.  Now I'm asking the KCS to be a time
     machine!  Hmmm....if I could access the clock with a macro....


Other Macros           
-----------------------
     There are, of course, the more mundane tasks.
     
     I send a rim-shot to my drum-machine instead of the using the metronome
     from the monitor.  It's not loud enough when the keyboards are playing
     and too loud when they are.  I usually forget to mute when I mix down
     (option ! from track mode) to open mode.  So, I have a macro that strips
     out A#3 on channel 10 (my drum's rim-shot).
     
     One macro splits my two-handed sequence on channel 6 (initially input in
     a split set-up from my TX81z).  It dispatches channel 6's low-end to
     channel 8 for a bass patch on my Matrix6, and channel 6's high-end to a
     guitar patch on my CZ1.  Obviously I tweak this preset as needed, not in
     frequently by outputting only the bass end to double the bass line on
     another instrument.
     
     Of course, I have a humanize preset that makes minor changes in time,
     velocity and duration.  I am incapable of using the timing shift options
     from the track screen (Shift-F1/F6).  Maybe others can use shift, but I
     find it utterly useless.  On the other hand I sure could use a real-time
     octave transposition or VARIABLE velocity or duration transposition. Ah
     well, I guess the old C64 and C128 version have yet to be completely
     blown away.
     
     I have one macro that does a controlled fade out with CC 7 (volume) over
     4 bars, and another over 8.  I rarely use it though, when I actually do
     taping I wind up forgetting it and fading out by hand.


Environment            
-----------------------
     I keep tracks 31 through 34 set up with 4 rudimentary drum beats; rock,
     all purpose latin, samba, and jazz. I have my first sequence prepared to
     play 8 bars of rim-shot in place of metronome. I "double" it from the
     edit screen if I want something longer.  Obviously I have chosen all
     appropriate "start-up" settings and saved them in DEFAULT.ENV on the
     program disk.  I know we're not suppose to write to the disk, and it
     gives me the heebie-jeebies doing it.  I have my back-up, and with as
     many options as the KCS and MPE-related software provides, I have to
     eliminate as much of the repetitious decision-making as possible to get
     anything done.
     
     I have a few sequences crammed full of sysex that I keep up in the 80's
     in open mode.  They sets up all 4 synths in some very specific stock
     set-ups;  ee-lectric rock, straight rock, jazz, orchestral 1, orchestral
     2. I also have a few small blocks of sysex in the 70's for specific
     instruments.  I use these to assemble larger blocks.  I find sysex work
     a little tedious frankly but having these little tools around makes
     mandatory storage a relatively brief process.  I also store the sysex
     blocks in individual SEQ files, stashed away on a Midi Utility disk, so
     I can always find them, and so they won't take up alot of my precious
     RAM.
     
     I have an ALL file with my current configurations, I call it CLR1.  I
     use it at start-up time or when I am CLRing one work session out of my
     way in preparation for another.  If I feel compelled to change this
     stock environment I call it CLR2, and decide later if it is fit to be
     the one-and-only CLR1.  If so I stash the old CLR1, and rename CLR2 to
     CLR1. This may seem obvious, but any techhead knows how rapidly safety
     files can accumulate.  Safety first--archive last!
     
     I try to keep all my set-up files named CLR1; the VRY files from the
     PVG, the TUN files from Tunesmith, the FGR files from Fingers, my Caged
     Artist patch bank dumps for the TX81Z, FB01 and Matrix-6.  It's nice to
     be able to load all the start-up files without excessive pointing,
     clicking OR typing.  Just return on CLR1 and let the file extention do
     your work.
     
     Also, I have used UIS for a couple of months now with KCS--from an auto
     folder, not as an ACC file, and can see not bad signs.  Being able to
     juggle files while in the KCS has been an unbelievable boon to my work.
     ReSTart, a similar replacement for the GEM file selector is NOT usable.
     It trashed a number of the seqs, some irreparably, that I was working on
     during the month or so it was part of my system.  It scattered very high
     timing values on DE's and PB's all over the place.

     This is one incredible package.  Just got it friday and have either
     been working my way through it's splendor or writing this missive all
     weekend.  "Don't start me talking, I tell everything I know" (Junior
     Wells/Buddy Guy).
