RE: TAPPING AS YOU HEAR THE MUSIC PLAY
  For those who really, really wish you could hear the music as you tap -
well, you CAN!   As the advertising stated - Tempo Master offers VARIOUS
WAYS to create a tempo map.  What you really are asking for is the one that
best suits you.  If you like to listen while you create a tempo map here
are three ways you can do it:

   1- Record the piece while creating a tap track with the pedal.  This is
the 'live' way to do it.
   2- Record the piece in straight real time (for 'feel' only assuming you
have a clean measured time track waiting) and later overdub a tap track.
   3- Play just the melody or some playable amount with one or both hands
on the keyboard while you tap on the pedal in time with the playing.
Remember to enable the Record Controllers for this.  Afterwards, convert
the pedaling to taps and split to another track.

   In all cases, tighten the taps up a bit, make the conversion, throw
away the RT>MUSIC sequence and apply the new RT>TEMPI sequence to your
measured tracks.

RE: TEXT_I_O.PRG
1) There is a file called READ_1ST.KTX in the \TMPLATS\ folder.  This file
describes the contents of each of the other .KTX files in this folder.  Do
as it says and read it first.

2) If you want to use your word processor to create .KTX files from already
existing files, simply load the file in question and make sure there is a
carriage return in the 68th column on each line.  Those of you with ST
Writer, Write, or the Diary 1.8 accessory will have no trouble with this
as carriage returns are visible.  Those of you with Word Writer - sorry!

=========================================================================

RE: TEMPO_MS.PRG

When you first read the manual and get to chapter 2, pages 5 through 10
introduce you to the items you see on the screen one by one.  Skim over
each briefly.  When you start doing the examples on page 11, you will
always be able to refer back to pages 5 through 10 when you have a question
regarding a specific feature. In other words, pages 5 through 10 may seem
somewhat meaningless until you've started the examples on page 11.

========================================================================
Real Time Tempo Clipping on page 1 refers to the 'T Max' feature and is
described in depth on pages 6 and 17 of the Tempo Master manual.

========================================================================

On page 12 - 'Recording tempo events part by part'. Please note that when
you set a new 'cue point' from the track play screen, you do NOT need to
turn the cue feature 'on'.  The Tempo Master only needs the numeric
setting to know where to start playing when the KCS play option is
selected. For example, if you wanted to hear the music from the beginning
regardless of where the 'Start' was set in Tempo Master, you would leave
the 'cue' setting at '1' on the track mode play screen.

=========================================================================

If you expected to see 75..75..75..75 after averaging, sorry.  The
averaging feature in Tempo Master looks at 3 consecutive tempos and places
the average in the middle position.  Therefore, 50+100+50/3=66 and
100+50+100/3=83.  The first and last tempos of the range averaged are not
affected.

=========================================================================

If you do own Dr. T's TIGER program, I recommend that you view track #1
after all of the examples to better see what the Tempo Master has created
or manipulated.

=========================================================================

"Why don't I get 4 tempo events when I tap 4 times?" you ask.  If you tap 4
notes when you record tempo events, you will only get 3 tempo events and a
'DE'.  This is due to the fact that it takes 2 taps to establish a tempo.
So 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 each establish 'a' tempo event which are assigned to
the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd events.  The 4th event becomes a 'DE'.

===========================================================================

In Chapter 3, as in Chapter 2, lightly skim over pages 19 through 21 and
refer back to them when you start getting actively involved with the
examples and your own experimentation.  It all may seem a little obtuse as
pure theory.

==========================================================================

pg.25 SPLITTING the taps from the Music - Version 3.0 offers a full SPLIT
option page.  The reason the Controller Conversion process adds '1' to the
midi channel of the converted events when Yes+ is selected is so you can
Split by midi channel instead of fiddling around with note names.  It's a
little quicker this way.

==========================================================================

Example#9 (page 25) - After you SPLIT the taps from the notes, you could
proceed directly to the Tempo Master and make an accurate conversion
without using the KCS Master Editor at all.  Simply set the Tap Hot Zone to
'15' (or a number slightly bigger than '12').  The main difference between
quantizing the Tap Track to the Music Track and using 'Tap Hot Zone' is:

     The Quantize method moves the taps to be in direct line with the notes
   they come with.
     The Tap hot Zone ONLY insures that there will be no 'time drift'
   meaning that time will not be lost if taps are slightly off. The symtom
   of this is that notes fall slightly short and eventually what should be
   measure 100 becomes measure 99.

   For real perfection in converting, I prefer the Quantize method.
However, setting the Tap Hot Zone to an appropriate number will insure
against 'time drift' even if the Quantize has been used. This is why I put
the Quantize method in this primary example and didn't mention Tap Hot Zone
until page 26.

==========================================================================

REAL TIME STEP ENTRY: pg. 29 -
  I could go on all day about this application because it is so handy,
friendly, and fast for anybody who wants to either read in notes from a
score or improvise 'slowly and out of time' on an original idea.  The
general concept here is that 'as you play, you simultaneously create the
tap track'.  You can accomplish this with the following combinations:

1 - Play both hands on keyboard, tap on the sustain pedal.
2 - Play Right hand and Sustain pedal, tap the left hand on low note.
3 - Play Left hand and Sus pedal, tap right hand on high note.

(I sometimes tap a very low note on my Roland RD-1000 with my left hand
while recording the left hand part with my right hand while pedalling!).
Of course, all of this takes a little practice and a little patience.

A frequent question from beta testers was "If you record the right hand
alone how can you get the left hand to sync up with it?".  And, of course,
the answer is "Once both have been converted and placed into measures,
they'll automatically be in sync!!  Ta-Dahhh!"

==========================================================================

You will find a new file in the \T_EXMPL\ folder called RL_TM_RC.TRK.  If
you have already loaded RL_TM_RC.ALL and have converted the files to
measured time, the finished files reside in OPEN Mode sequences.  If you
then wish to use the REAL STEP TIME ENTRY application to append these
sequences, go to track mode and load the RL_TM_RC.TRK file. This set
you up to record in track mode while leaving the sequences in open mode
intact.


When recording tempo events in parts for a sequence as prescribed on page
12 of the manual please note that you must re-merge all of the other tempo
tracks (using the [\] key) in order to hear the results as only Track '1'
plays tempo events.  This is a little bit of a pain but is the way the
current 3.0 version of the KCS works.  If you have an older version, it may
still recognize tempo events in other tracks.  Experiment a little to find
out.

======================================================================
Version 1.2 (June 22, 1990)

SWP1 Box

There is a new box in the lower right portion of the screen called SWP1
which stands for 'SWaP with track 1'.  After you create a new tempo on
track 1, you may wish to compare it to a previously made tempo map in
another track.  As tempos are only played in track 1 and as you cannot
swap any track with track 1 within the KCS, the inclusion of this
routine was essential.  To use it, click (and hold) on the number
(default '3') in the lower half of the box and scroll to the number of
the track that you want to swap with the 1st track.  To execute the
swap, click in the upper half of the box on the word SWP1. If there are
no events in the selected track, you will be alerted and no action will
be taken.  If the process is successful, you will also be alerted.  I
recommend that track 1 be the current sequence when swapping (although
it need not be.).  This way you can see the new name in the KCS Status
Box.  If you want to swap the original tempo map with a different tempo
map, simply click on SWP1 again (to restore the original order), change
the swap number by scrolling to the number of the different track, and
click SWP1 once again.

There are 3 new .KTX templates in the \TMPLATS\ folder:

1 - BILLHEAD.KTX - this is a simple bill head example using
JeRBil, Inc as an example.  Of course, it could be edited for
studio time billing.

2 - FBLLHEAD.KTX - this is the same bill head with formatting (if
you are using an Epson compatible printer. Try it out.

3 - PRT_TEST.KTX - load and print this file to see exactly how
Epson compatible your printer is....

Two Bugs in the KTXT_1_5.PRG have been fixed.

1 - The disappearing cursor when the Item Selector appeared.
2 - The save routines now have 'error' checking including bad
paths.

=================================================================
August 17, 1990

Yet an even newer version of KTXT_2_0.PRG.

A clock has been added.  This clock defaults to the current system time
and date upon loading.  A new time and date can be entered following the
conventions of normal GEM dialog boxes meaning that the [Backspace] and
[Delete] keys can be used to edit the entered text, and [Esc] can be used
to clear the line for entirely new time and date entry.  In addition,
typing a ':' on the time line or '/' on the date line will move you
automatically to the next space after that symbol.  For the new time to
be set, you must click in the 'set new time' exit box.  You will then see
an alert box which gives you the opportunity to set the new time
precisely at the 'top of the minute' (:00 seconds) if this is critical
for your purposes.  Upon setting the time you are returned to the KCS.

As a programmer, I find having the correct time and date is essential for
later identifying files on disk.  Be aware that there are 2 clocks in the
ST and that this feature sets both of them.


================================================================

A small bug involving 12 noon and 12 midnight in the TIMEDATE.PRG has
been corrected and some screen directions have been changed so as to be
more clear.

================================================================
9/1/90

The Tempo Master MPE has been updated to Version 1.3 as it now supports
the 'load and exit' feature of the KCS versions 3.0 and greater.  When it
is automatically loaded with the KCS.INF directive, it will immediately
exit so as to allow the following files to load.  This is a nice time
saving feature.  Hats off to Dr.T's!


================================================================
The KCS Text Mode I/O MPE program is now Version 2.1.  It has also been
updated to support the KCS 'load and exit' MPE feature.  The only
difference here is that you will not see the K TXT screen.  You will
only know it has been loaded by the presence of the 'Ktx' symbol in the
KCS itself.

===============================================================
9/2/90

- If you are up-dating from Tempo Master MPE Version 1.2 or lower, you
will notice an appreciable speeding up of screen graphics.  If you're
not, you won't.
- A bug in typing the [C] for real-time conversion has been fixed. It
would create 2 duplicate tempo tracks. OOps!

===============================================================
9/26/90

Doug Livingston, of ANY_PROG.MPX fame, discovered an incompatibility
between Tempo Master and Turbo ST.  The bug creating the incompatibilty
has been fixed.  In addition, there has been a problem with the screen
'locking'.  I have a feeling the Turbo ST fix has solved this other
problem as well.  (In order to fix this problem I purchased Turbo ST and
recommend it highly.  It really does speed things up! Nice program...)

===============================================================
11/4/90

There is a new folder on the program disk called PRE_KCS.V_3.  The MPE
modules in this folder are for those of you with prehistoric versions
ofthe KCS prior to Version 3.0.  They do not support the Load and Exit
feature and must be used instead.  Use TM_PRE_3.INF instead of
TEMPO_MS.INF and use KTX_PRE3.INF instead of KTXT_2_1.INF.  They are
identical with the wonderful exception that they will not 'crash the
program' upon loading.


================================================================
1/1/90

The Text Mode I/O program has undergone some cosmetic surgery.  The dialog
box is now much larger.  Each category of operation now has its own
seperate area which is delimited by a box outline.  In addition, the .KTX
save has been made the default as I find myself using this format 95% of
the time.

Both the KTXT_2_2.PRG and TEMPO_MS.PRG have been renamed to KTXT_2_2.MPE
and TEMPO_MS.MPE so that you will not try to run them from the desktop.  I
only mention it here in case you miss the program icons.  Just click on
the .INF files from within the KCS's MPE environment and both .MPE's will
load.

==================================================================

REAL TIME BARLINES!!
I have included a new feature which allows you to tap along (in the KCS)
with a track(s), and then convert the new 'tap' track to SM events.  When
subsequently merged with the conductor track, you will be able to access
any part of the piece BY MEASURE NUMBER in a real time performance!

Procedure for Use:
(1) Load or record something in real time (no metronome).
(2) Create a new track by recording one note at a time only on the 1st
beat of each measure only.
(3) From the new 'tap track' edit page, enter the Tempo Master MPE and
click on '[M]Event->SM' (or type [M]).  Answer 'Yes' to the alert box. You
will be immediately returned to the tap track edit screen and will notice
that all of your note events have been converted to SM (steps per measure)
events and the name of the track will have been changed to 'All -> SM' for
identification on the play screen.  Each SM event bears the time to the
next event.  Clever, huh!
(4) Now go to the track mode play screen by typing [F1] and merge (typing
'\') the new tap track with the conductor track '1'.

HINTS:
~ You may want to use the Blend page of the Master Editor to quantize the
tap track to one of the real time tracks (the rhythmically busiest one).
~ Clean any SMs out of track one before merging in the new SM track and
eliminate extraneous 'DE' events.  Try to make Track '1' the approximate
length of the music.  Also, leave the TM (tempo event) in track '1' at
which the real time tracks were recorded.  This should be the first event
with a time of '0'.


When you set cues now, the real time recording will start at the correct
spot.  And, if you own TIGER (which is highly recommended), the barlines
will agree with the printed score.

One note of precaution, the smallest number of steps per measure allowed
by the KCS is '8'.  If you accidentally hit 2 notes together while
creating the tap track, the one with a time of 'zero' will cause the note
before it to be converted to a SM of '8', thus throwing things off a bit.
Another way of saying this is DON'T ALLOW CHORDS IN THE TAP TRACK.  This,
of course, is consistent with the creation of Real Time Conversion 'tap'
tracks.

                              PLEASE NOTE: NO MORE 'LOCAL ON/OFF'
                              In order to find a place for this new
                              feature, I eliminated an old and unused
                              feature.  As the KCS now supports 16
                              channels across 4 different output
                              ports, I have eliminated the Local
                              On/Off feature from Tempo Master MPE.
                               It is somewhat redundant and requires
                              that your controller keyboard be on the
                              'A' output line which may not always be
                              the case.

Velocity of '0' Note Off bug in TIGER
-------------------------------------
Because of a bug in TIGER, editing notes with long durations can be a real 
problem.  You may have noticed, when editing velocities, notes becoming 
strangely long all of a sudden for no apparent reason. I have discovered 
that this happens because notes with a velocity of '0' act as notes off 
for notes with durations greater than '999'.  However, TIGER allows you to 
change the velocities of these '0' velocity note-ons, thus screwing up the 
whole works.....

                "Velocities of '0' to Note Off" to the rescue!!!!

Just type [0] followed by [Return] or left click in the box provided at 
the bottom of the screen.  This makes all those nasty notes with a 
velocity of '0' real NOTES OFF.  And, TIGER deals with correctly.

                Stand Alone VEL02OFF Module
                ---------------------------
Because you may want this function by itself, (until Emile fixes that bug 
in TIGER (a grrrrrr-eat program), I have created a stand-alone MPE module 
called VEL02OFF.MPE, which is very small (memory-wise) and performs the 
function very quickly by clicking on it from the KCS edit page once it is 
loaded using VEL02OFF.INF.

I know your asking - "What do NOTES OFF have to do with Tempos?"

                Answer: 'Absolutely nothing'.  

As a professional, I needed it in MY work - so enjoy it.  To quote Prof. 
Brown in Back To The Future "I figured - what the hell..."
