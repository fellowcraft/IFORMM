More hints from Emile Tobenfeld, a.k.a. Dr. T.

One of my favorite musical processes is improvisation. MIDI sequencing
programs such as Tiger and KCS provide an ideal way to combine the processes
of improvisation and composition. Simply record the improvisation as a
sequencer file, and then use your software to edit and orchestrate it. I
usually improvise with a software program such as Fingers, Tunesmith, or the
(as-yet unpublished) MIDI-Ax, but the principle is the same when using a 
MIDI keyboard, drum, guitar, or other controller, or even an ensemble 
combined with a MIDI merger.

An essential part of this process is the extraction of the sections that
you want to work with from  a long improvisation. I have found  
some of Tiger's features extremely helpful in this process, and have just
added a couple of features to make it even easier. I use the ability of 
Tiger to play a range that has been highlighted with the mouse, or to 
highlight the region that is currently playing, and the 
ability to use the All Tracks to Seq feature to merge the selected range
into a single sequence for later editing within KCS. (KCS, of course, will
allow me to de-channelize that range and put it in Track Mode for further
overdubbing and/or Tiger editing.)

To find the section(s) that I want, I may highlight different regions and 
use the return key to play them. I may also just use the right mouse play
feature to try to find a good starting point. The Tab key is useful to 
go back to the beginning of the current play region, and the Shift/Tab to
extend it.

If I have found a good starting point, and want to try different endings, I
will use the (newly implemented) Backspace key, to cause the program to
loop at the very instant I press it. If I find that I looped too soon, I
can Shift/Tab to extend the play range. If I like the end point of the
current range, but want to try different starting points, I will try the
new Alt/Shift right mouse click, which (provided play is the selected
right mouse option) starts play at the click point and continues to the
end of the current range. 

Once I have the desired region playing, I can highlight it by pressing
the / key on the numeric keypad, and then use All Tracks to Sequence as
mentioned above.
