     I. SWITCHER 3.02   

     With STEINBERG programs like CUBASE, CUBEAT, TWENTY FOUR,   

     SYNTHWORKS, AVALON, MIMIX etc it doesn't matter in which order 
     you plug in the keys in the MIDEX - slots because the keys are 
     recognized by the SWITCHER automatically.

     However, when using the SWITCHER and MIDEX with 
     NON-STEINBERG products the Function- keys are now related to the 
     corresponding MIDEX - slots:

                       F 1  .... MIDEX - Slot 1   

                       F 2  .... MIDEX - Slot 2   

                       F 3  .... MIDEX - Slot 3   

                       F 4  .... MIDEX - Slot 4   

                       F 5  .... MIDEX - Slot 1   

                       F 6  .... MIDEX - Slot 2   

                       etc.  

     

     If you don`t want to use the SWITCHER take the

     

     II. KEYSLOT - Accessory    

     ( KEYSLOT.ACC, installing with INSTALL.PRG )    

     by clicking on "NEXT SLOT" ( "DESK" Menu ) you can switch 
     between the MIDEX - slots.

     drivers:

     IV. Additional Score- Symbols are Repeats, Double bar line and 
     Change Clefs.

     

     

     V. MIDI MANAGER

     Object Definition Box: by pressing ALTERNATE and changing a value, 
     e.g. choosing a differnt OUTPUT, you can alter this value in all or all 
     selected objects when the box is closed with "OK".

     

     

     VI. Using BIGSCREEN Monitors:

     When a Bigscreen Monitor is connected and CUBASE is loading, there 
     will be a box that displays a VDI or a QUICK driver. Depending on 
     the monitor you use, check out which driver will run with CUBASE.

     QUICK is only for monochrom monitors.

     The monitors MATRIX M110 and ATARI SM 194 use the QUICK driver.

     Score printout is only possible with monochrom monitors.

     If you are using the VDI driver you have to copy the contents of 
     the GDOS folder (on CUBASE PRG disk) and the FONTS folder ( Disk 
     II ) to your BOOT disk.

     If GDOS is already in use you have to add the neccessary Fonts to 
     the existing ASSIGN.SYS. CUBASE uses all Fonts that are listed in the 
     ASSIGN.SYS file.
