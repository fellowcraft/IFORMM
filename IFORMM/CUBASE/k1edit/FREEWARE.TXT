Bob Melvin has now allowed Free trading of his "old" editors called "The Caged
Artist " series.However he does not want to be involved at all with Atari, as
he has "moved on" to the Mac and PC platforms for his work. So it was up to the
Atari-Midi Community to find Downloadable copies of the programs. This
particular copy of K1-Edit/ K5 Edit is a "liberated" copy, meaning it was "liberated"
before the time when all Caged Artist series were lifted from
copy-protection.Thus you will see the MCA message on the Bank Editing page.
However since Bob Melvin has declared free trading of his Caged Artist
Products, we are offering this download untill a copy can be found that
has copy-protection lifted without the MCA message.If you know of such a copy,
please contact Tim Conrardy via the "Tim's Atari Midi World" web site.
Thank you.Enjoy These excellent editors!
