\ FORMULA uses multiple vocabularies to hide words that are of interest only in
\ certain contexts. These vocabularies are:

\	internals	( words not intendes for direct user access )
\	loaded		( per-file compilation words -- used for recompile )
\	ap-defs		( words relevant to note-playing process definitions )
\	sh-defs		( words relevant to shape definitions )
\	td-defs		( words relevant to time deformation definitions )
\	sg-defs		( words relevant to sequence generator definitions )
\	standard-MIDI-defs (instrument defs based on standard #s )

\ Fortmacs maintaines a "search list" of vocabularies to be scaned during word 
\ lookup. Words such as :ap add the relevant vocabulary to the search list.
\ The following:

\	only forth also definitions

\ restores the search list to its default state (forth is Forthmac's main
\ vocabulary). This is often done at the start of source files, and it's often
\ necessary to do it manually after a compilation error.

\ Beware of the following mistake: if you redefine a word in say, ap-defs, and
\ mistakenly put the definition in the "forth" vocabulary, subsequently
\ definitions using :ap see the old definition of the word since ap-defs 
\ precedes "forth" in the search list.
