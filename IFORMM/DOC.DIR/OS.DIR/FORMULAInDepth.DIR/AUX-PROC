\ As explained earlier , when a note-playing process uses a $-word to play a 
\ note , it generally specifies only the pitch of the note. The other 
\ parameters (such as volume and duration) are obtained from puans and 
\ AUXILIARY PROCESSES. Auxiliary processes can also be used to change the tempo
\ of note-playing process. An auxiliary process can be "attached" to either
\ a process or a group. In the later case, it affects all processes and its 
\ descendants. Auxiliary processes allow you to separate musical
\ "interpretation" from the musical "score".  

\ Each note-playing process (object) has a set of "slots" for auxiliary 
\ processes. The slots are either "local" (the auxiliary process affects only
\ that one note-playing process, or "global" (the auxiliary process affects all 
\ note-playing processes, and is shared with other processes). Not all slots 
\ need to be occupied; if the note-playing primitives find and empty slot they
\ take a resonable default action. A slot is a pquan that is either zero or
\ points to the CB of an auxiliary process. A note-playing word can contain
\ "embedded auxiliary process definitions" that create new processes in its 
\ slots or those or those of its local or global contexts.

\ The constructs for embedded auxiliary process definitions are:

\ SYNTAX             LOCATION         PURPOSE          PROCESS TYPE

\ ::tsg ... ;;sg     self             note duration    sequence generator

\ ::gtd1 ... ;;td    global context   tempo control    time deformation
\ ::gtd2 ... ;;td    global context   tempo control    time deformation

\ If desired, parameters can be passed to the new process using [ n params ].
