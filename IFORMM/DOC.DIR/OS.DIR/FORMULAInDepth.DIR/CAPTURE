
\ MIDI File Capture

\ You can capture FORMULA's MIDI output in a standard MIDI file using the
\ following words:

\ MF-init    ( n --- ; create an n-byte buffer for MIDI capture )
\ MF-start   ( --- ; begin capturing MIDI output in the buffer )
\ MF-stop    ( --- ; stop capturing MIDI output )
\ MF-write filename   ( --- ; write buffer contents to file )

\ The resulting MIDI file can be used by sequencers and other MIDI programs.

\ Your MIDI capture buffer must be large enough for all the output between MF-
\ start and MF-stop; each note uses about 22 bytes.  The word

\ MF-memused  ( --- n )

\ returns the number of bytes in the capture buffer that are currently used, and

\ MF-reset    ( --- ; )

\ deletes the current buffer contents.
