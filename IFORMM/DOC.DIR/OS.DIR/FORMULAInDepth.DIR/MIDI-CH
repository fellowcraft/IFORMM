
\ MIDI channels

\ The $-words use several quans and pquans to obtain note parameters. In some
\ cases, their meanings depend on which output paradigm is used. The pquans
\ are all inherited on process creation.

\ $channel (pquan) is used to decide which synthesizer channel(s) are used
\ for notes played by this process.
