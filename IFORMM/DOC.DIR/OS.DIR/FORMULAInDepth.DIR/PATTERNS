
\ Rhythm Patterns

\ The words above require that rhythms be generated sequentially.  Sometimes 
\ it is easier to use a random access approach.  FORMULA provides the following
\ mechanism for this.  A rhythm pattern represents a fixed number of pulses,
\ some of which are "attack points" at which notes are played.  Pulses are 
\ numbered starting at 0.

\ pattern   ( name ; n --- ; define an pattern "name" with n pulses )
\ +bt       ( pulse# pattern --- ; add an attack point )
\ -bt       ( pulse# pattern --- ; remove an attack point )

\ For example:

6 pattern my-pattern
1 my-pattern +bt
4 my-pattern +bt
5 my-pattern +bt

\ defines a rhythm pattern named my-pattern of 6 pulses with attack points at 1,
\ 4, and 5.  Rhythm patterns are used by timing sequence generators:

\ play-pattern    ( tactus pattern --- ; )

\ generates the rhythmic sequence given by the pattern, where each pulse has
\ length 1/tactus (e.g., tactus = 8 for 8th-note pattern).  For example,

\ 1|8 my-pattern play-pattern

\ plays notes on 8th notes 1, 4 and 5 of a 6/8 measure.
