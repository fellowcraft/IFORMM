IFORMM is a black box data-processing system for electronic music designed by 
Frank H. Rothkamm.

IFORMM's software functions as a scriptable real-time generative transformer, 
random process generator and bitgraphics visualizer. It has it's own OS. 

IFORMM's hardware inputs are messages from Oxygen8, UC-33 and MS20 Controllers and
it's output are system-exclusive messages to the FB01, TX7, TX81Z, K5m modules
and the Atari YM2149 sound chip.
 
IFORMM's software runs on specifically configured Atari STE EMulator, with 
MIDITHRUWAY and MIDIYOKE for multiple midi input. 

IFORMM incorporates the legacy of great men and their code: 
Moore's FORTH computer language, Bradley's FORTHMACS implementation for ATARI
computers, Anderson/Kuivila's FORMULA multi-processing, scheduling and midi
handling system and the Hayward Brother's realization of STEEM, an ATARI STE
emulator.

IFORMM is applied retro-computing.

==============================================================================
1986: In Vancouver, British Columbia, I learned from Kenneth Newby to program
MIDI in the very esoteric but fascinating language called Forth.

1988: In Berlin Rupert Nieberle & I founded a computer music research 
group called CAMP at the Technical University and started working with an
esoteric but fascinating superset on Forth called Formula.
It was invented by Ron Kuivila & David Anderson and allowed the realtime 
programming of multiple processes.

1989: Back in Vancouver I was asked by Science World of British Columbia to 
program an installation called "paintmusic": visitors should be able to draw a
picture and the computer would transfer this in realtime into music, similar to
Iannis Xenakis' UPIC system. 
To do this I grabbed Jesse Taylor's line-a calls, took some hints from Dan 
Scheidt and invented a superset on Forth, called G.O.D (Graphics On Drugs),
because it  enabled interaction with algorithms under the influence of
mind-altering substances.  

1990: Over the years many additions were added in San Francisco & New York:
Sys-X & Csound interface, random & rhythm fractions, sliders, etc. All these
were grouped in a folder called FLUX and could be complied to a new system.

1998: Peter Sansom was the first person beside myself to work with the
system. I formalized all files and this lead to a scripting language called
IFORM.

2002: The input was extended with USB controllers and the mapping project 
of CC to SysEx was implemented first for the FB01, utilizing code from 1988. 
This became IFORM88, now a hardware/software hybrid system. The Atari 
STE EMulator became very stable and all software was moved from a physical 
to a virtual Atari. This became IFORMM.

-> "Planet Genius" (Flux Records) CD
    under the pseudonym of Frank Genius. 
    [ethno-tech] 

-> "Mystery of the Leaping Fish" (Flux Records) CD-EP 
    under the pseudonym of Frank Rothkamm.
    [computer sounds & whales communication]

-> "Presto Chango" (Yamaha Disklavier Festival)
    under the pseudonym of Frank Rothkamm
    [processed Haydn]  

All of my post-summer-2002 work is using exact IFORMM:

-> "FB01" (Flux Records) CD
    under the pseudonym of rothkamm
    [sci-fi serialism]
	
-> "FB02" (Flux Records) CD	
    under the pseudonym of ROTHKAMM
    [sci-fi serialism]
