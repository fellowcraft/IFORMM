\ FORTMACS is an implementation of the FORTH-83 standard with many enhancements,
\ and includes a version of the Emacs text editor. Forthmacs has many features
\ that set it apart from other Forth implementations:

\ * File system interface

\   Fortmacs uses named files instead of disk blocks, adn provides the 
\   following file commands:

\	fload	( file-name ; --- ; load (interpret) a file )
\	ed	( --- ; invoke the Emacs text editor )
\	more	( file-name ; --- ; view a file W/ pagination )
\	cd	( directory-name ; --- ; enter a subdirectory )
\	rm	( file-name ; --- ; delete a file )
\	mv	( oldname newnwme ; --- ; rename a file )
\ 	ls	( --- ; list directory contents )

\ * Command completion

\   If you type the strat of a word name, <control><space> will extend it to a
\   complete name if possible. This saves typing when using long names. 
\   <control>? prints the names that extend the current word fragment.

\ * Command history

\   <control>p and <control>n cycle back and forth trough a list of recent
\   command lines; this can be used to avoid retyping long commands.

\ * Command-line editing

\   Command lines (including those resurrected by <control>p) may be edited 
\   with intra-line Emacs commands: <return> causes the entire line to be 
\   executed, regardless of cursor position.

\ * Decompilation and On-Line Documentation

\   The following words faciliate on-line source code browsing:

\	see	( name ; --- ; decompile a word )
\	.calls  ( CFA --- ; )
\	whatis	( name ; --- ; print 1-line summary )

\   See can, in most cases, completely reconstruct a word's definition from its
\   compiled form. This allows you to conveniently persue the source code of
\   Forthmacs and FORMULA. .call lists all words that call a given word. whatis
\   prints 1-line summary of a word (this uses the files whatis.doc and 
\   whatis.ind on the release disk; it doesn't work for FORMULA words.

\ * Deferred Words

\   Forthmacs allows a form of forward reference using deffered words. Such a
\   word is declared by:

\	defer foo

\   It may then be used in other word definitions. It must later be bound to an
\   actual definition (say blah) using:

\	' blah is foo

\ * Structured 68000 Assembler

\   Forthmacs provides a 68000 assembler that uses Forth-like control structures
\   for generating conditional branches. The assembler uses 8-bit branch 
\   offsets. This is inadequate for control structures in large words, so 
\   FORMULA provides a set of structures using 16-bit offsets; see the file in
\   the Formula.dir lbranch.

\ *****************************************************************************

\ The rest of this file lists the EMACS editing commands grouped by the 
\ functions they perform. EMACS commands generally involve the CONTROL key or 
\ the ESC key (ESC stands for Escape). Rather than write out ESCAPE or CONTROL 
\ each time we want you to prefix a characte, we'll use the following 
\ abbreviations:

\ 	^<chr>	    means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>
\ 		    Thus, ^F would be: hold the Control key and type F

\    ESC-<chr>	    means type <Esc>, release it, then type the character <chr>

\ Important note: if you must exit at some point, type ^X^A

\ At the bottom of the screen is an area called the echo area or mini-buffer.
\ The echo area contains the bottommost line of the screen. The line 
\ immedeately above them is called the MODE LINE. The mode line says something
\ like:

\ * ForthEMACS -- 4thmacs -- File: 4thmacs ------------------------------------

\ This is very useful "information" line.

\ The star means that you have made changes to the text. Right after you visit
\ or save a file, there is no star.
